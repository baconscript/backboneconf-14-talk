it in your Backbone applications. Before I dive in, though, I&#39;m going to very

  It's like a sealed terrarium: the little ecosystem in a terrarium is entirely dependent on what you
  put into it at the beginning. If you put too few plants or too little water, the ecosystem
  will turn out very differently than if you put in the right number of plants or the right
  amount of water. More importantly, the terrarium won't change global state. You won't have vines
  growing all over your kitchen or bugs in your bedroom. It's entirely self-contained, just like
  a pure function.--><div data-body-class="dark" class="el"><table style="width:100%;"><tr><td colspan="2"><h4>Imperative vs. functional</h4></td></tr><tr><td style="width:50%;"><div class="el"><h5>Imperative</h5><pre>var list = getListSomehow(),

On the right we have the imperative version. We&#39;re responsible for keeping track of state
through the loop, in this case using the <code>i</code> and <code>sum</code> variables.</p>
<p>On the right we have the functional version. To create the new list, we simply
<code>reduce</code> over the old one. You can see that we use this <code>reduce</code> function to neatly tuck
away all the details, and we&#39;re not left creating these temporary variables. This is a very
simple example; if you really want to see differences between declarative and imperative,
just find some code that&#39;s been written in Java and in Scala. The two languages each encourage
a very different style of coding.</p>
</div></div><div data-body-class="dark" class="el"><h3>In <em>declarative programming,</em> the focus is on <strong>what you want to do</strong>.</h3><h3>In <em>imperative programming,</em> the focus is on <strong>how you want to do it</strong>.</h3><div class="note"><p>My example highlights the main difference between imperative and functional programming.
In functional programming, which is declarative, the focus is on <em>what you want to do</em>;
in imperative programming, the focus is on <em>how you want to do it</em>.</p>
</div></div><div data-body-class="dark" class="el"><h4>The vocabulary of Underscore</h4><div class="note">In 2010, we got the 1.0 release of Underscore, which brought all these lovely functional bits
to JavaScript. We gained a powerful vocabulary that allowed us to specify just what we want
to do, and rely on Underscore to take care of the fiddly details. We've got:</div><div class="defs"><div class="el"><h5>map</h5><p>Converts values</p><div class="note"><p>map to convert values
filter to remove values
reduce to summarize, and so on, and so forth.</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><h5>filter</h5><p>Removes values</p></div><div class="el"><h5>reduce</h5><p>Summarizes values</p></div><div class="el"><h5>findWhere</h5><p>Locates values</p></div><div class="el"><h5>any</h5><p>Checks existence of values</p><div class="note"><p>To me, functional reactive programming (FRP) is a very natural next step. The BaconJS
documentation looks very much like the Underscore documentation, in that it gives us
a vocabulary with which we build programs. Once you get used to using this vocabulary,
though, you do get a bit spoiled. Personally, when I switch from BaconJS to plain 
JavaScript it feels a little like I&#39;m writing assembly code, just because I get used to
these abstractions that Bacon gives me.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve talked enough about things other than BaconJS; now I&#39;m going to give you all some 
examples.</p>
</div></div></div></div><div data-body-class="dark" class="el"><div class="note"><p>The central primitive in functional reactive programming is usually called an Observable
or a Signal. I prefer the term &quot;immutable stream&quot; because it fully describes what you&#39;re
working with.</p>
</div></div><div data-body-class="dark" class="el"><h3><p>A <em>stream</em> is a series of related <strong>events</strong> and <strong>errors</strong> that <strong>may terminate</strong>.</p>
</h3><div class="note"><p><em>Streams</em> are pretty straightforward: a stream
is a series of related events and errors that may terminate. Here&#39;s an
example:</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><div id="key-stream"></div><div class="note"><p>This is a stream of <code>keyup</code> events, which is very easy to generate using Bacon.</p>
<p>Events can wrap any JavaScript value: booleans, numbers, objects, and even
Bacon streams.</p>
<input></div><div class="el"><div id="sample-error"></div><div class="note"><p>Streams may also have errors in them. Let&#39;s suppose for a second that the
stream here represents a particularly unreliable weather API. The X&#39;s
represent AJAX errors, which you would want to handle differently in your
application. It&#39;s Bacon&#39;s try/catch. If you&#39;re used to promises, just think
of a stream as a promise that can resolve more than once.</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><div id="sample-end"></div><script type="x/on-enter">var weather3 = Bacon.fromBinder(weatherBinder()).name('weather').take(3);
weather3.asBubbleStream({element:'#sample-end'});</script><div class="note"><p>Finally, we have a stream here that emits a couple of values, then ends.
Once a stream has ended, it emits a special &quot;end&quot; event and nothing more.</p>
<p>Now, I mentioned that these are immutable. You can&#39;t change a stream once
you&#39;ve created it, but you can perform operations on streams to create
new ones, in precisely the same way you operate over collections using Underscore.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="el"><div id="weather-good"></div><div class="note"><p>So here we&#39;ve got another weather report stream. Really this is all just random numbers, but
suppose for a minute.</p>
</div><div class="el"><div id="weather-filter"></div><div class="note"><p>Now I&#39;ve taken it and filtered it to create a slightly
nicer weather forecast. If it&#39;s colder than 41 degrees out, then I don&#39;t
want to know. Our original stream hasn&#39;t been altered at all, we&#39;ve just created 
a new one with the information we&#39;re interested in.</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><div id="weather-map"></div><div class="note"><p>Now we take that and format it slightly. We can take this stream and
update a <code>div</code> directly with it; Bacon&#39;s API gives us...</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><code><pre>weather.filter(t =&gt; (t &gt;= 41))
  .map(t =&gt; t+"&amp;deg; F")
  .assign($('#temp-display'),'html');</pre></code><h3 style="float:right;position:absolute;top:-0.5rem;right:0;padding-top:0;" id="temp-display"></h3><div class="note"><p>...an easy way to directly update our <code>div</code>. You can take a stream and use <code>assign</code> on
it to make it have side-effects; in this case, updating HTML content.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="el"><div id="scan-1"></div><div class="el"><script type="x/on-enter">showScan();</script><div id="scan-2"></div></div><div class="note"><p>Reduce also has a parallel in Bacon: it&#39;s <code>scan</code>. Here I&#39;m taking a stream of numbers and
using scan to create a real-time updating sum. There&#39;s also another function called
<code>reduce</code> which will wait until your stream closes and emit a single reduced value. Both are
analagous to Underscore&#39;s <code>reduce</code> function, it&#39;s just that <code>scan</code> constantly updates and
<code>reduce</code> emits a single value at the end. Both are useful in different scenarios.</p>
<p>One point I&#39;d like to make about <code>scan</code> is that it creates a special kind of stream which
Bacon calls a Property. Properties and streams are very similar, but conceptually they 
differ. A stream is considered to be a series of discrete, separate events, whereas a
Property is one continuous value that changes over time. Bacon treats them mostly the same,
but there are a couple of cases in which they differ.</p>
<p>Bacon also provides us with a couple of ways to combine events from multiple streams.</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><h5><code>.merge()</code></h5><script type="x/on-enter">showMergeExample();</script><script type="x/on-exit">hideMergeExample();</script><div id="merge-ex1"></div><div id="merge-ex2" class="el"></div><div id="merge-ex3" class="el"></div><div class="note"><p>There&#39;s <code>merge()</code>, which grabs events from both streams. Here we&#39;ve got a stream of red A&#39;s
and a stream of blue B&#39;s, and <code>merge</code> creates a new stream with all events on it. This is
useful for instance if you have a search box with a button next to it. If you want to create
a stream of enter key presses and button clicks, <code>merge</code> is your function.</p>
</div><div class="el"> <div style="width:100%;" class="ui small action input"><input type="text" placeholder="Enter search term"><div class="orange ui button">Search</div></div><div class="code"><pre>$('search-field').asEventStream('keyup')
  .filter(x =&gt; x.keyCode === 13)
  .merge( $('#search-btn').asEventStream('click') )
  .onValue(search);</pre></div></div></div><div class="el"><h5><code>.combine()</code></h5><script type="x/on-enter">showCombineExample();</script><script type="x/on-exit">hideCombineExample();</script><div id="combine-ex1"></div><div id="combine-ex2" class="el"></div><div id="combine-ex3" class="el"></div><div class="note"><p>There&#39;s also <code>combine()</code>, which allows you to run a function on the latest event from each
stream to create your events. Here it&#39;s grabbing the color from the first stream and the
number from the second.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to bore you all with the <em>entire</em> API here, but there&#39;s one higher-level 
method you need to understand if you&#39;re going
to do anything useful with Bacon: <code>flatMap()</code>. <code>flatMap()</code> takes a stream where each
event is itself a stream, and puts all the values from all the streams it sees onto
a single stream. I know that sounds a little cryptic, so here&#39;s an example.</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><h5><code>.flatMap()</code></h5><script type="x/on-enter">showFlatMapExample();</script><script type="x/on-exit">hideFlatMapExample();</script><div id="flatmap-ex-urls"></div><div class="note"><p>Suppose we&#39;re getting URLs somehow---user input, some automated event
perhaps, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
</div><div class="el"><!--#flatmap-ex-ajax-streams--><center style="width:100%;"><img src="./img/metastream.png"></center><div class="note"><p>We take these, and we map each URL to an AJAX call. An AJAX call is a perfect example
of why a stream is a promise with added functionality. You make the request, and what
you receive back is a representation of a future potential for response or error.
Bacon actually has a utility function that converts a promise into a Bacon stream, so
you can use it almost without thinking.</p>
<p>I could have done this example as an animation like the others as well, but frankly I
couldn&#39;t get it to look right with CSS, so here&#39;s a static image.</p>
<p>You can see here that each URL has been mapped to a stream. I&#39;ve just drawn the AJAX
streams as arrows here, since it would get way out of control if I tried to actually
make and animate streams within the events.</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><div id="flatmap-ex-ajax-flat"></div><div class="note"><p>Finally, we use <code>flatMap</code> to take all our replies and flatten them into one stream.
This is how you would generate a stream of weather updates, for instance, like I
showed earlier.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="el"><code><pre style="text-align:center;">map() filter() reduce() scan() 
take() diff()
flatMap() flatMapLatest()
delay() throttle() bufferingThrottle()</pre></code><div class="note"><p>All this vocabulary---<code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>merge</code>, <code>flatMap</code>, and friends---makes up
almost a whole new language in its own right, with its own control flow. The fact that you have this new control
flow means you have to fundamentally attack your problems in a different way. Naturally, this is one reason why
you may want to consider <em>not</em> using FRP. It&#39;s got a steep initial learning curve. Because the streams are
immutable, you have to get away from the idea of variables and focus more on events. It&#39;s awesome once you&#39;ve
mastered the basic concepts, but until then it sucks a bit. I can compare it to learning Vim or Emacs---you&#39;re
going to go through a period of really horrible non-productivity while you&#39;re learning, but then once you&#39;ve
paid your dues you gain these superpowers.</p>
<p>A side effect of this is that you also have to learn the vocabulary. If you sit down and read through the
documentation a couple of times, you&#39;ll get a good feel for the types of things Bacon does and does not do.
Again, to compare it to Underscore: when I was learning Underscore, I&#39;d think of a function like <code>every()</code> or
<code>any()</code> that just seemed like it was the &quot;kind of function&quot; that Underscore &quot;would have&quot;, and I&#39;d check the
docs and sure enough I&#39;d find it. Bacon has the same kind of thing where you get a feel for it and you learn
the types of functions that Bacon might provide. I guess, to stick with the theme of the conference, you could
say that Bacon has a flavor.</p>
<p>Now, pure functional programming is great if you&#39;re an academic, but ultimately you really do need to have some
effect on the real world. &rarr;</p>

having some sort of global state. By far, the easiest place to do this division is to have Bacon.js handle
internals, and to have Backbone models keep track of their own state. Bacon becomes this sort of tucked-away
plumbing, and your Backbone models simply work.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to now go through a few recipes for combining Bacon with Backbone: some good, some bad. I&#39;m starting
off with the bad one.</p>
</div></div><div id="bb-stream-slide" class="el"><script type="x/on-enter">Bacon.interval(2500, 'Backbone.Model')
  .name('stream of models')
  .asBubbleStream({element:'#model-stream'});</script><script type="x/on-exit">$('#bb-stream-slide .stream').html('');</script><div id="model-stream"></div><div class="note"><p>One of the simplest is to use a stream of models to update a View. This is honestly a little insulting to
Backbone. You&#39;ve got these rich models which know things about themselves and can update themselves on the
server, and here they&#39;re performing the same essential task as a plain JavaScript hash could. A better
way is to...</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><div id="model-event-stream"></div><script type="x/on-enter">Bacon.interval(2500, 'change')
  .name('model.asEventStream("change")')
  .asBubbleStream({element:'#model-event-stream'})</script><div class="note"><p>...use one model, and passing events to your View. This is another dead-simple model,
and probably most familiar to those of you who use...</p>
</div><div class="el"><code><pre>model.on('change', () =&gt; view.render(model.toJSON()))</pre></code><div class="note"><p>...something like this. The Bacon version of that is this:</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><code><pre>model.asEventStream('change')
  .onValue( () =&gt; view.render(model.toJSON()))</pre></code><div class="note"><p>This is useful for updating your views, but it&#39;s also useful if you have multiple people pontentially editing
a resource and you want to prevent conflicts. If instead of updating a view, you want to sync with a server,
you can send these change events. If the server is receiving change events from multiple users, then you can
decide at the server level how to resolve any conflicts and send the results back out to the users.</p>
<p>In the context of the previous talk, you could actually even write your events to localStorage during any
period when your app is offline. When your app reconnects with the server, it can just send up all the events
from localStorage, and the server can decide what to do about conflicts at that point.</p>
<p>Or, to avoid re-rendering your entire view when you don&#39;t have to, maybe when you see an
update you perform a jQuery selection and only update a particular portion of your view. 
You can replace that with this:</p>
</div></div><div class="el"><div id="model-event-field-stream"></div><script type="x/on-enter">Bacon.repeatedly(2500, ['foo','bar','baz'])
  .name('model.asEventStream("change:fieldname")')
  .asBubbleStream({element:'#model-event-field-stream'})</script><code><pre>model.asEventStream('change:name')
  .onValue( () =&gt; view.$('.name').text(model.get('name')))</pre></code><div class="note"><p>This gives you really fine-grained control over your updates, and you can render only the
parts of your view that have changed.</p>
<p>Now, these examples in and of themselves are fairly useless. The power comes when you want
to compose them or modify them. If you already have your application running on streams,
it becomes trivial to change the way the streams flow through your application.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="el"><table style="width:100%;"><tr><td style="width:50%;"><h5>Client-side</h5><code><pre>socket = io();
