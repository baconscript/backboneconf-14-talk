# Further reading

* [BaconJS documentation](http://baconjs.github.io)
> Great place to look. I recommend reading the entire thing once or twice before starting coding so you get a sense of all the methods that are available to you.

* [The intro to Reactive Programming you've been missing](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)
> A gist that explains from the
ground up what FRP is in straightforward language. Uses RxJS for examples, but lots of graphics to get the point across really well.

* [RxJS](http://reactive-extensions.github.io/RxJS/)
> Another implementation of FRP, and the one that the above _Intro_ uses.

* [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
> Language for writing really pretty functional reactive programs. Compiles to JS and runs in the browser.

* [Streem](https://github.com/matz/streem)
> Language by [Matz](https://github.com/matz) (work in progress) announced a few days ago. Describes stream operations in terms of "piping" like a bash shell.

* [js-csp](https://github.com/jlongster/js-csp)
> If you've decided that FRP isn't for you, or you just want to explore options, you may be interested in communicating sequential processes (CSP). This is like Go's Goroutines or ClojureScript's `core.async`. It's another wildly different way of handling events and I recommend at least taking a look.
